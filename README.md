# ArduinoProject (DMP)
Current state of the project:
  - I have created a distance sensor using an ultrasonic sensor and a LED module (having 6 leds).
  - In order to include interrups, I have chosen the external ones. 
  - We have two buttons (K1, K2) which are used for swithing between lighting modes.
  - First Mode: the LEDs turn on sequentially as the object gets closer relative to the ultrasonic sensor, and shut down as it moves away.
  - Second Mode (opposite): the LEDs shut down sequentially as the object gets closer relative to the ultrasonic sensor, and turn on as it moves away.
